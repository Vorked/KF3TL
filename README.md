# Introduction

KF3TL is Vorked's project to translate Kemono Friends 3 into English. This includes BepInEx and XUnity to handle translations using a mix of machine translation and thousands of lines of hand-written translations and regex.

Currently, this mod will only work with the DMM build of the game. If you'd like to assist in getting the mobile version set up, let me know.

# Included Files

- BepInEx x64 5.4.21.0
- XUnity AutoTranslator 5.2.0 for BepInEx
- Pip's KF3Tweaks text fitter DLL
- Vorked's Translation Pack

# Features

- Textures to make menus and in-game content in English
- Over 3000 lines of hand-translated text
- 150 lines of regex designed to translate dates, funds, resources, and more
- Hundreds of pre and post processing entries to assist in forcing autotranslated content to behave as needed
- DeepL for automatic text translation for untranslated content
- Pip's KF3Tweaks text fitter to make more portions of the game fit into text boxes for cleaner visuals

# VPN Guide

The following is a guide for installing and using a free, open source VPN to launch and install DMM and also to use DMM to launch Kemono Friends 3.

# UPDATING THE TRANSLATIONS

The current version of the translation mod, which dictates all translations and translated assets is at version 11.6. However, you will need to manually update by using this link here, which will update over time. Placing this inside of the BepInEx folder will update all text and texture translations. This link will always contain the most up-to-date version of the mod, and if you're confused on how to install it, the VPN and KF3 Installation Guide can show you where to place the folders.

# Who Am I? What is this project?

I am Vorked, and I have been working on this translation pack since February. Most of the work was figuring out how to do this project with no understanding of coding. After being shown someone's attempt at a fully machine translated mod of Kemono Friends 3, I decided to take it into my hands to begin translating everything properly, including textures.

I've been a fan of the series for a very long time and I was tired of not being able to understand what was happening in the game. At the time, all translation attempts for KF3 were all but dead, as well. If I didn't do it, it felt nobody would. Thus the project was born.

However, this project has been a one-man-show for a pretty long time, now. There was some help with regex from Havox, and some extra translation substitutions given by KenjiDraco, but this was mostly it in terms of content not done by myself. It's time-consuming, to say the least.

# Disclaimer

This translation project is **not** affiliated with Kadokawa, Sega, Appirits, or Mine Yoshizaki.
Everything in this project is built using hand-made assets and content and nothing is used, modified, or replaced.
No game files are modified, replaced, or otherwise changed in any way.
This mod follows the game's terms of use for not modifying files. However, you never know if Sega, Appirits, or Kadokawa see otherwise.
I am not liable for any issues encounted in using this mod.
